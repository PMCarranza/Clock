# **Clock**
Analog clock created using HMTL, CSS and JavaScript.  I am adding the day and date to the face as well.

## **Description**
The sole purpose of the clock is for me to get some practice and have some fun with it.
I have made it my own by adding a picture of my cat as the face of the clock and the day and date where the 3 would be (as if it was a wrist watch).

## **Technologies**
    • HTML
    • CSS
    • JAVASCRIPT
    • JQUERY

## **Visual**
<img src="./images/clock.png">

## **Usage**
The clock does nothing more than tell you the time and date, what you do with that information is up to you, use it wisely.

## **Support**
I am available to answer questions about this clock at marino.carranza@gmail.com

## **Roadmap**
I am happy with how it works butI would like to add a different face to the clock for am and pm hours, maybe a different color scheme to go along with it as well, we will see.

## **Contributing**
At the moment I am the only one working on this.

## **Acknowledgements**
I would like to thank "Web Dev Simplified" youtube channel because it was here that I first came accross the analog clock and I use some of their code to get started.

## **Project Status**
I do not know at this time how far I want to go with this, it will be on a holding pattern for now.
